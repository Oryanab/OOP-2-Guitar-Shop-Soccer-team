### Four Pillars Of OOP

## Abstraction , Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphism

# Abstraction (simplify):

Abstraction refers to showing only the essential features of the application and hiding the details.

# Inheritance:

ability to inharit funcionaility between classes, The class which is inherited from, is called the base class, and the class which inherits the code from the base class is called a derived class. A derived class can use all the functions which are defined in the base class, making the code reusable.

# Encapsulation(hiding):

is a technique of restricting a user from directly modifying the data or variables of a class in order to maintain the integrity of the data.

# Polymorphism:

It is a feature, which lets us create functions with same name but different arguments, which will perform differently. That is function with same name, functioning in different way. Or, it also allows us to redefine a function to provide its new definition.
